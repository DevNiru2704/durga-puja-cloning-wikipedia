            Durga Puja, also known as Durgotsava or Sharodotsav, is an annual Hindu festival originating in the Indian 
            subcontinent which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess Durga, and is also celebrated because of Durga's 
            victory over Mahishasura. It is celebrated all over the world by the Hindu community, but it is particularly 
            popular and traditionally celebrated in the Indian state of West Bengal, and other states like Bihar, Assam, 
            Tripura, Odisha, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh (eastern parts) and some other countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and 
            Sri Lanka. The festival is observed in the Indian calendar in the month of Ashvin, which corresponds to 
            September-October in the Gregorian calendar. Durga Puja is a ten-day festival, of which the last five are of 
            the most significance.The puja is performed in homes and public, the latter featuring a temporary stage and 
            structural decorations (known as pandals). The festival is also marked by scripture recitations, performance arts,
            revelry, gift-giving, family visits, feasting, and public processions called a mela.Durga Puja is an important 
            festival in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism. Durga Puja in Kolkata has been inscribed on the 
            intangible cultural heritage list of UNESCO in December 2021.

            As per Hindu scriptures, the festival marks the victory of goddess Durga in her battle against the 
            shape-shifting asura, Mahishasura. Thus, the festival epitomizes the victory of good over evil, though it is 
            also in part a harvest festival celebrating the goddess as the motherly power behind all of life and creation. 
            Durga Puja coincides with Navaratri and Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism.

            The primary goddess revered during Durga Puja is Durga, but celebrations also include other major deities 
            of Hinduism such as Lakshmi (the goddess of wealth and prosperity), Saraswati (the goddess of knowledge 
            and music), Ganesha (the god of good beginnings), and Kartikeya (the god of war). In Bengali traditions, 
            these deities are considered to be Durga's children, and Durga Puja is believed to commemorate Durga's 
            visit to her natal home with her beloved children. The festival is preceded by Mahalaya, which is 
            believed to mark the start of Durga's journey to her natal home. Primary celebrations begin on the 
            sixth day (Shasthi), on which the goddess is welcomed with rituals. The festival ends on the tenth day 
            (Vijaya Dashami), when devotees embark on a procession carrying the worshipped clay sculpture-idols to a 
            river, or other water body, and immerse them, symbolic of her return to the divine cosmos and her marital 
            home with Shiva in Kailash. Regional and community variations in celebration of the festival and rituals 
            observed exist.

            Durga Puja is an old tradition of Hinduism, though its exact origins are unclear. Surviving manuscripts from 
            the 14thâ€”century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records suggest that royalty and wealthy 
            families were sponsoring major Durga Puja festivities since at least the 16th-century. The prominence of Durga Puja 
            increased during the British Raj in the provinces of Bengal, Odisha and Assam. However, in modern times, the 
            importance of Durga Puja is more as a social and cultural festival than a religious one, wherever it is observed.

        <p>
            Over the years, Durga Puja has morphed into an inseparable part of Indian culture with a diverse group of people 
            celebrating this festival in their unique way while on tradition.

        <h2><u>About the project</u></h2>

        <p>
            Hi, I am Nirmalya Mandal. This is my first html project that i have tried to make by myself without any guidance.
            This is basically a cloning project where i try to copy the information present in Wikipedia.
            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja">Here's the link btw</a>)
        </p>

        <h3><u>Notes from the creator:</u></h3>

        <p>
            <strong><u>25/10/2023</u></strong><br/>
            I created this project specifically because its Durga Puja right now and also i wanted to make use of all the
            things that I learnt about HTML. Unfortunately, I don't have any knowledge about CSS and javascript right now.
            So i can neither design the website nor make the website interactive. But in the future when I learn those
            I will update my project accordingly. Subho Bijaya.
