            The sculpture-idols for the puja are traditionally made of biodegradable materials such as straw, clay, soil, and wood. 
            In today's times, brighter colored statues have increased in popularity and have diversified the use of non-biodegradable, cheaper or 
            more colorful substitute synthetic raw materials. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the paint used to produce the 
            statue, stating that the heavy metals in these paints pollute rivers when the statues are immersed at the end of the Durga festival.

            Brighter colors that are also biodegradable and eco-friendly, as well as the traditional natural colors, are typically more expensive 
            compared to the non biodegradable paints. The Indian state of West Bengal has banned the use of hazardous paints, and various state 
            government have started distributing lead-free paints to artisans at no cost to prevent pollution.
