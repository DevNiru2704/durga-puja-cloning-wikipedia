            Months before the start of Durga Puja, youth members of the community collect funds and donations, engage priests and artisans, 
            buy votive materials and help build pandals centered around a theme, which has rose to prominence in recent years. Such themes have 
            included sex work, celebration of humanity, marginalization of queer persons and transgender persons, folk culture, 
            celebration of cinema, womanhood, pro-environment themes, while others have chosen metaphorical themes such as celebration of 
            maati (literally, soil or ash) and "finding one's own light". Pandals have also been replicated on existing temples, structures, and 
            monuments and yet others have been made of elements such as metal scraps, nails, and turmeric among others. Durga Puja pandals have 
            also been centered around themes to acknowledge political events such as the 2019 Balakot airstrike and to protest against the National
            Register of Citizens of India.

            The budget required for such theme-based pujas is significantly higher than traditional pujas. For such theme-based pujas, 
            the preparations and the building of pandals are a significant arts-related economic activity, often attracting major sponsors. Such 
            commercialized pujas attract crowds of visitors. The growth of competitiveness in theme-based pandals has escalated costs and scale of 
            Durga Puja in eastern states of India. Some segments of the society criticize the billboards, the economic competition, and seek return 
            to basics. The competition takes many forms, such as the height of statue. In 2015, an 88-foot statue of Durga in Kolkata's Deshapriya 
            Park attracted numerous devotees, with some estimates placing visitors at one million.
