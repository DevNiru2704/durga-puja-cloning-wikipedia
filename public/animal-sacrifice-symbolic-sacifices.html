            Shakta Hindu communities mark the slaying of Mahishasura and the victory of Durga with a symbolic or actual sacrifice. 
            Most communities prefer symbolic sacrifice, where a statue of the asura is made of flour or equivalent, is immolated and smeared 
            with vermilion, symbolic of the blood that had spilled during the battle. Other substitutes include a vegetable or a sweet dish 
            considered equivalent to the animal. In certain instances, devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, and practice alternate 
            means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.

            In communities performing actual sacrifice, an animal is sacrificed, mainly at temples. In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, 
            animal sacrifices are performed at Shakta temples to commemorate the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura. This involves slaying of a 
            fowl, pig, goat, or male water-buffalo. Large scale animal sacrifices are rare among Hindus outside the regions of Bengal, Odisha, 
            Assam, and Nepal. In these regions, festivals are primarily when significant animal sacrifices are observed.

            The Rajputs of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses in the related festival of Navaratri, and some historically observed the 
            sacrifice of a goat, a practice that continues in some places. The sacrifice ritual, supervised he the priest, requires slaying 
            of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. 
            The Kuldevi (clan deity) among these Rajput communities is a warrior goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during 
            Rajput-Muslim wars.
