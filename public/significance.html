            Beyond being an art festival and a socio-religious event, Durga Puja has also been a political event with regional and national 
            political parties having sponsored Durga Puja celebrations. In 2019, West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee announced a grant of 
            ₹25,000 to all community-organised Durga Pujas in the state.

            In 2019, Kolkata's Durga Puja was nominated by the Indian government for the 2020 UNESCO Representative list of the Intangible Cultural 
            Heritage of Humanity. Durga Puja also stands to be politically and economically significant. The committees organising Durga Puja in 
            Kolkata have close links to politicians. Politicians patronize the festival by making donations or helping raise money for funding of 
            community pujas, or by marking their presence at puja events and inaugurations. The grant of ₹25,000 to puja organizing committees in 
            West Bengal by a debt-ridden state government was reported to cost a budget a ₹70 crores. The state government also announced an 
            additional grant of ₹5,000 to puja organizing committees fully managed by women alone, while also announcing a twenty-five percent 
            concession on total electricity bills for puja pandal. The government had made a grant of ₹10,000 each to more than 20,000 puja 
            organizing committees in the state in 2018.

            A 2013 report by ASSOCHAM states West Bengal's Durga Puja to be a ₹25,000 crores worth economy, expected to grow at the compound annual 
            growth rate of about 35 per-cent. Economic slowdowns in India, such as in 2019, have hence affected corporate sponsorships and puja budgets for 
            public celebrations. In August 2019, the Income Tax Department of India had allegedly sent notices to various Durga Puja organizing committees 
            in West Bengal, against which the ruling party of the state, All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) protested. The Central Board of Direct Taxes 
            denied sending any such notices, to which AITMC politician Madan Mitra is reported to have said that the intention may have been to enquire if 
            tax deducted at source had been deducted on payments to vendors for organizing community pujas.

        <h2><u>Economic significance</u></h2>
        <p>
            Durga Puja directly affects the economy. In 2022, the economy of West Bengal was estimated to get a boost of 50,000 crore rupees. 
            The annual GDP of West Bengal was expected to be expanded by 20-30 percent that year. The factors responsible for this economic boost 
            are mainly the increase of earning in transport, tourism, industry, business, shopping and other fields. The Kolkata Metro Railway 
            recorded an earning of ₹6 crore in just five days of Durga Puja in 2022.

            The famous puja pandals get sponsorship from renowned companies and labels. Usually, the dress and jewelries of the idols, the stuffs 
            used to make the pandals, decorations, lightings are sponsored.
        </p>
        <h2><u>Social significance</u></h2>
        <p>
            Durga Puja plays a great significance in the living of certain peoples. The kumors, those who make the idols with clay and also makes 
            other clayey products, earns lakhs of rupees by selling a single set of Durga idol of average size. Hence, it makes their annual income 
            because idols used in other festivals are a lot more cheaper. Other professions that receive the majority of their annual income are 
            dhaaki (plays dhaak), priest and other small homecrafts. It is assumed that these profession based small classes would become smaller 
            in population if Durga Puja was absent.

        <h2><u>Media attention</u></h2>
        <p>
            The day of Mahalaya is marked by the Indian Hindu community of West Bengal with Mahishasuramardini — a two-hours long All India Radio 
            program — that has been popular in the Bengali community since the 1950s. While in earlier days it used to be recorded live, 
            a pre-recorded version has come to be broadcast in recent decades. Bengalis traditionally wake up at four in the morning on Mahalaya to 
            listen to the radio show, primarily involving recitations of chants and hymns from Devi Mahatmyam (or Chandi Path) by Birendra Krishna Bhadra 
            and Pankaj Kumar Mullick. The show also features various devotional melodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dramas enacting the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura are telecasted on the television. Radio and television channels also air other 
            festive shows, while Bengali and Odia magazines publish special editions for the puja known as Pujabarshiki  or Sharadiya Sankhya. 
            These contain works of writers, both established and upcoming, and are more voluminous than the regular issues. Some notable examples 
            of such magazines in Bengali are Anandamela, Shuktara, Desh, Sananda, Nabakallol, and Bartaman.
